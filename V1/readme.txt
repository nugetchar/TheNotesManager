NOTES MANAGER


°Who is Notes Manager?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are Hanane Mezzine and Thomas Toledo, two students from the UTC, a french school of engineering. We work in computer sciences and really love to think and create softwares.

This year, one of our teachers gave us a project to do: the Notes Manager.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

°What is Notes Manager?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Notes Manager is a software which gives you the possibility to create, edit and delete
every type of notes (audio, video, text, picture).

Actually, the project is over (we gave it back to our teacher), but we have decided to improve it. In order to do this, we thought about GitHub, to allow averyone to participate to this project.

So, feel free to ask us new functionalities, to propose your own release (we'll put it on our github in a special repository with your name). Currently, we didn't have finish the interface yet, but we keep on working on it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

°What are the technologies used?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used Qt for the interface.
The language is C++.

You can do you own version, with Eclipse, in Java, Ruby: whatever! The goal to reach is to provide to the user something which runs perfectly ;)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

°How do I use your project?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the sources and the Doxygen documentation. Then read it, understand the code, and do your thing :p
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

°How can I contact you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use one of our GitHub account to host the files, but you can contact us to notesmanager.github@gmail.com.
If you have any questions, any suggestions (like:"please, improve your skills in English, you make a lot of mistakes, that's horrinle, my eyes are bleeding"), please tell us. We'll be glad to answer and to work with you.
